# Cylc UI Server

This project contains the Cylc UI Server which serves the Cylc UI
and communicates with running Cylc Schedulers. It also bundles the GUI.

## Introduction

The functionality in this repository is required to run the Cylc web user
interface.

This repository provides the following components of the Cylc system.

* **The UI**

  This is the Cylc web app that provides control and monitoring functionalities
  for Cylc workflows.

  > The UI is developed in a separate repository https://github.com/cylc/cylc-ui

* **The UI Server**

  This is a web server which serves the Cylc web UI. It connects to running
  workflows and workflow databases to provide the information the UI displays.
  It is a [Jupyter Server](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server).

* **The Hub**

  In multi-user setups this launches UI Servers, provides a proxy for running
  server and handles authentication. It is a
  [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) server.


## Installation

[![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cylc-uiserver/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cylc-uiserver)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cylc-uiserver.svg?color=yellow)](https://pypi.org/project/cylc-uiserver/)
![Conda-Platforms](https://img.shields.io/conda/pn/conda-forge/cylc-uiserver)

For more information on the Cylc components and full-stack Cylc installations
see the
[Cylc documentation](https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/latest/html/installation.html).

### For Single-User Setups

Via conda (preferred):
```bash
conda install cylc-uiserver
```

Via pip:
```bash
pip install cylc-uiserver
```

### For Multi-User Setups

Via conda (preferred):
```bash
conda install cylc-uiserver-hub
```

Via pip (consult jupyterhub documentation):
```bash
pip install cylc-uiserver[hub]
```


## Running

The Cylc UIServer is a
[Jupyter Server](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server)
extension (like [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)).

### For Single-User Setups

Run as a standalone server using a URL token for authentication:

```bash
# launch the Cylc GUI and open a browser tab
$ cylc gui

# alternatively the same app can be opened with the jupyter command
$ jupyter cylc
```

> By default, authentication is provided by the URL token. Alternatively, a
> password can be configured (see Jupyter Server docs).
>
> There is no per-user authorisation, so anyone who has the URL token has full
> access to the server.

### For Multi-User Setups

Run a central [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) server
under a user account with the privileges required to spawn `cylc` processes as
other users.

```bash
# launch the Cylc Hub
# (the default URL is http://localhost:8000)
$ cylc hub
```

> Users then authenticate with the hub which launches and manages their UI
> Server.


## Configuring

### Hub

The Cylc Hub will load the following files in order:

1) System Config

   These are the Cylc defaults which are hardcoded within the repository.

   (`<python-installation>/cylc/uiserver/jupyter_config.py`)

2) Site Config

   This file configures the Hub/UIS for all users. The default path can be
   changed by the ``CYLC_SITE_CONF_PATH`` environment variable.

   (`/etc/cylc/uiserver/jupyter_config.py`)

3) User Config

   This file

   (`~/.cylc/uiserver/jupyter_config.py`)

Alternatively a single config file can be provided on the command line.

```bash
cylc hub --config
```

> **Warning:**
>
> If specifying a config file on the command line, the system config containing
> the hardcoded Cylc default will **not** be loaded.

> **Note:**
>
> The hub can also be run using the ``jupyterhub`` command, however, you
> must source the configuration files manually on the command line.

See the JupyterHub documentation for details on configuration options.

### UI Server

See the [Cylc documentation](
https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/latest/html/reference/config/ui-server.html)
for all Cylc-specific configuration options.

The Cylc UI Server is a
[Jupyter Server](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server) extension.
Jupyter Server can run multiple extensions. To control the extensions that
are run use the `ServerApp.jpserver_extensions` configuration, see the
[Jupyter Server configuration documentation](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/other/full-config.html#other-full-config).

By default the Cylc part of the UI Server log is written to
`~/.cylc/uiserver/uiserver.log`.

<!--
TODO: Link to Jupyter Server logging_config docs when published
-->

### UI

The UI can be configured via the "Settings" option in the Dashboard.

Currently these configurations are stored in the web browser so won't travel
around a network and might not persist.

Contributions welcome:

* Read the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.
* Development setup instructions are in the
  [developer docs](https://cylc.github.io/cylc-admin/#cylc-8-developer-docs).
* Involved change proposals can be found in the
  [admin pages](https://cylc.github.io/cylc-admin/#change-proposals).
* Touch base in the
  [developers chat](https://matrix.to/#/#cylc-general:matrix.org).

1) Install from source into your Python environment:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .[all]
   ```

   > **Note:**
   >
   > If you want to run with a development copy of Cylc Flow you must install
   > it first else `pip` will download the latest version from PyPi.

2) For UI development follow the developer instructions for the
   [cylc-ui](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-ui) project, then
   set the following configuration so Cylc uses your UI build
   (rather than the default bundled UI build):

   ```python
   # ~/.cylc/uiserver/jupyter_config.py
   c.CylcUIServer.ui_build_dir = '~/cylc-ui/dist'  # path to build
   ```

Note about testing: unlike cylc-flow, cylc-uiserver uses the
[pytest-tornasync](https://github.com/eukaryote/pytest-tornasync/) plugin
instead of [pytest-asyncio](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio).
This means you should not decorate async test functions with
`@pytest.mark.asyncio`.
