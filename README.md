## Installation

To install the production version, run:

- `pip install cylc-uiserver`

And for the development version, run the following from a clone of the project
git repository.

- `pip install -e .`

Once that is done, the Hub can be started with `jupyterhub`.
The default URL is [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Starting multiple instances of jupyterhub

If you need to run multiple instances of `jupyterhub`, you will have to follow
the steps described below:

- copy `jupyterhub_config.py` to a different location
- change the following settings (change the ports to your environment):
    * `c.JupyterHub.bind_url = 'http://:7000'`
    * `c.JupyterHub.hub_bind_url = 'http://127.0.0.1:7878'`
    * `c.JupyterHub.proxy_api_port = 9001`
- finally start `jupyterhub` using that configuration file
